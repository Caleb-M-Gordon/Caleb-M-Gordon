## Hi there! I’m a vertebrate paleontologist 🦖 currently researching how mammals changed in response to drastic global warming ~56 million years ago.


## 🎓 I graduated from Bowdoin College in 2018, and received my PhD in the Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences at Yale University in 2025, where my dissertation research focused on the evolution of aquatic 🌊 and macrocarnivorous 🍖 lifestyles in reptiles 🦎🐊🦅. My research focuses on the environmental and evolutionary processes responsible for behavioral innovation in extinct mammals and reptiles. I pursue this work using a combination of classic paleontology methods, phylogenetic machine-learning algorithms, and 3D modeling techniques. 


## I'm now a Postdoctoral Researcher at the Florida Museum of Natural History, where I use these methods to understand how extinct mammals responsed to past episodes of climate change. 


## 🌱 I’m currently learning GitHub and Python so that I can apply emerging deep-learning tools to research these topics.
