## Hi there! I’m a vertebrate paleontologist 🦖 at the University of Florida 🐊 researching how mammals changed in response to drastic global warming ~56 million years ago.

## 🎓 My research focuses on the environmental and evolutionary processes responsible for behavioral innovation in extinct mammals and reptiles. I pursue this work using a combination of classic paleontology methods, phylogenetic machine-learning algorithms, and 3D modeling techniques. For more information about my work, feel free to check out my website! [CalebMGordon.com]

## 🌱 I’m currently learning Python so that I can incorporate deep-learning tools into my research.
