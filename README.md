## Hi there 👋

<!--
**Caleb-M-Gordon/Caleb-M-Gordon** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- 🔭 I’m a vertebrate paleontologist 🦖 currently researching how mammals changed in response to drastic global warming ~56 million years ago.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python and GitHub so that I can apply emerging deep-learning tools to research this topic.

- I'm currently a Postdoctoral Researcher at the Florida Museum of Natural History, advised jointly by Drs. Jonathan Bloch, Arthur Porto, Paul Morse, and Natasha Vitek. 

- 🎓 I received my PhD in the Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences at Yale University in 2025, where my dissertation research focused on the evolution of aquatic (🌊) and macrocarnivorous (🍖) lifestyles in reptiles (🦎🐊🦅). I received my BA in Biology and Philosophy with Honors at Bowdoin College (🐻‍❄️) in 2018.

- More broadly, I study the environmental and evolutionary processes responsible for behavioral innovation in extinct mammals and reptiles. I pursue this work using a combination of classic paleontology methods, phylogenetic machine-learning algorithms, and 3D modeling techniques.
