## Hi there! I’m a vertebrate paleontologist 🦖 currently researching how mammals changed in response to drastic global warming ~56 million years ago.


## 🎓 I received my PhD in the Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences at Yale University in 2025, where my dissertation research focused on the evolution of aquatic 🌊 and macrocarnivorous 🍖 lifestyles in reptiles 🦎🐊🦅. I received my BA in Biology and Philosophy with Honors at Bowdoin College in 2018. Most broadly, I study the environmental and evolutionary processes responsible for behavioral innovation in extinct mammals and reptiles. I pursue this work using a combination of classic paleontology methods, phylogenetic machine-learning algorithms, and 3D modeling techniques. 


## I'm currently a Postdoctoral Researcher at the Florida Museum of Natural History, where I research the evolution of extinct mammals in response to climate change. 


## 🌱 I’m currently learning GitHub and Python so that I can apply emerging deep-learning tools to research these topics.
