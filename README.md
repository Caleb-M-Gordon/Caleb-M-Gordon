## Hi there! I’m a vertebrate paleontologist 🦖 at the University of Florida 🐊 
#### 🎓 My PhD research focused on how aquatic and macrocarnivorous habits evolved in reptiles during the time of the dinosaurs.
#### 🔭 My postdoctoral work focuses on how mammals adapted to global warming ~56 million years ago.

###

### 🔬 I pursue this work using a combination of approaches:
##### 🦴 Classic paleontology methods
##### 📈 phylogenetic machine-learning algorithms
##### 🌐 3D modeling techniques. 

### 

### For more info about my work, feel free to check out [my website](https://www.calebmgordon.com).

### 🖥 My previous coding work was done in R and Unix.

### 🌱 I’m currently learning Python so that I can incorporate deep-learning tools into my research.
